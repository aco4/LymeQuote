## Welcome to LymeQuote

LymeQuote is a project created for the Biomedical Science program at Bel Air High School.

It is a website made to educate as many people as possible on Lyme disease and the autoimmune pandemic.

<!-- The website operates under the premise of a quote sharing website, where users can browse quotes, save their favorites (COMING SOON), and share them with others (COMING SOON). People can even create their own (COMING SOON)! -->



<!-- # Overview

### An Alarming Problem
Lyme disease is the fastest growing vector-borne infectious disease in the United States. By 2050, estimates predict 12% of the U.S. will be affected.

There is compelling evidence that Lyme disease is also the source of chronic disorders such as autoimmune conditions — but on this topic, the medical community is corrupt, stubborn, and mind-bogglingly backwards.

### Encouraging Action
Through my reading of the medical novel Chronic: The Hidden Cause of the Autoimmune Pandemic and How to Get Healthy Again by Dr. Steven Philips and Dana Parish, I recognize one of the main reasons the world has not leaped into action: lack of awareness.

Chronic does an amazing job revealing the urgent nature of this pandemic, but public knowledge of this topic is low. To educate as many people as possible on Lyme disease, I created an attractive website that uses social networking to gain more visitors. The website is entertaining, but it also raises awareness of Lyme disease at the same time.

# Background

_“Perhaps you yourself are among those who have struggled with chronic illness, or strange, migrating symptoms that no one seems to take seriously… your symptoms that were carelessly labeled as ‘autoimmune.’”_

Today, 24 million Americans are affected by the mysterious “autoimmune disorder” — but this incidence rate is much higher than it should. These strange symptoms are caused by a hidden culprit: Lyme disease.

### What is Lyme?
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection commonly transmitted through bug bites. It is extremely difficult to address for several reasons:
- Lyme is a crafty bacteria, with many elusive abilities;
- The symptoms are varied and not understood, causing neurological, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular illness;
- No one is immune and there are no vaccines;
- Official medical guidelines are outdated and negligent, making diagnosing and treating Lyme impossible unless you see a specialist;

but most notably,
- the astounding lack of awareness of Lyme disease’s link to autoimmune disorders, in both the public and in the medical community.

### Failure of the Medical Community
The suggestion that Lyme can cause autoimmune disorders goes against medical teachings and knowledge, to the point that doctors literally laugh when presented with such ideas.

As a result, most Lyme patients end up visiting 20 to 100 doctors before being correctly diagnosed — if they ever are.

Although there is progress towards addressing Lyme disease, the general public is unaware. Lyme has not gotten the headlines it deserves. As Russel Johnson of the University of Minnesota said in 1987: “Were it not for AIDS, Lyme disease would be what we are all worrying about.”

# Experience

### An Eye-Opening Novel
I came across the topic of Lyme disease and autoimmune disorders from a novel I happened to spot at my local library. This novel was called Chronic: The Hidden Cause of the Autoimmune Pandemic and How to Get Healthy Again by Dr. Steven Philips and Dana Parish.

In Chronic, Dr. Philips and Dana Parish (both survivors of Lyme), explore how this rapidly growing vector-borne disease and others like it are often the root of elusive autoimmune disorders, even though most doctors vehemently deny this fact.

Upon reading it, I was blown away by the reality of the situation. I was moved so deeply that I knew I wanted to center my entire project around it.

### Reputable and Reliable
I was surprised by how well-sourced Chronic was. Published in 2020 and containing hundreds of cited studies, it described in extreme detail everything I could ever wish to know about Lyme disease, backed up with bulletproof science.

As such, I was able to gather data on Lyme disease and its link to autoimmune disorders primarily from my reading of this medical novel.

### Well-Covered
This book thoroughly revealed to me how Lyme disease is truly the greatest medical crisis of the 21st century, from both a biological and political perspective. This book covered:
- Why is Lyme disease (and this area of medicine) so misunderstood?
- Why is testing so difficult? Where is diagnostic technology lacking?
- Why does the medical system not know how to treat Lyme disease?
- What are the symptoms of Lyme disease and how does it progress?
- How can an infection cause an autoimmune disorder, neurological illness, and more?
- What do we need to do in order to combat Lyme disease?

# Innovation

### Incorporating Lyme Disease
The quotes that users can browse will include popular quotes, adages, and proverbs, but some will be about Lyme disease. In this way, visitors will read them and learn about Lyme.

To allow people to learn more about these quotes and their messages, I also implemented a feature where each quote comes with a description.

Through the description, the website can educate people more in-depth by directly explaining the context, or even by providing links to outside sources, such as Chronic.

### Attracting Visitors
To reach as many people as possible, I sought inspiration from other popular websites, such as Facebook, Spotify, and Wordle.

That’s why I implemented a quote-sharing feature, allowing users a convenient way to share quotes with friends, which gains more visitors and more people who can be made aware of Lyme disease.

Other attractive features of the website include a daily quote, so people are incentivized to keep coming back to the website.

### The Technicals
The website is written with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it is hosted on GitHub Pages. To accomplish this, I self-taught myself how to use HTML, CSS, and GitHub. I relied primarily on GitHub documentation and Stack Overflow forums.


# Conclusions

### The Problem
Autoimmune disorders are possibly the most misunderstood disease of the 21st century, causing widespread, unexplainable effects on the body.

When presented with these symptoms, doctors are left dumbfounded. But instead of searching for the real cause, medical institutions around the world prescribed these symptoms a simple label: the mysterious “autoimmune disorder.”

### The Experience
For my experience, I read though a medical novel written by Dr. Steven Philips and Dana Parish, called Chronic: The Hidden Cause of the Autoimmune Pandemic and How to Get Healthy Again.

In their book, they describe the stories of affected victims, detail the characteristics of Lyme disease, and expose the medical system’s inability to properly address this massive pandemic.

### The Solution
It’s true that diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease is inadequate, and much help is needed in this sector. However, I believe that the first step towards addressing Lyme disease is by educating the critically unaware public.

As a solution, I developed LymeQuote, an engaging website intended to educate as many people as possible on the topic of Lyme and autoimmune disorders by attracting as many visitors as possible.
